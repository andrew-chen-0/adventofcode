# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Solutions for **[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)**, written in **Java**. 
AoC is an Advent-calendar-style set of programming puzzles released daily in December, each day with two parts that get progressively trickier.

This repo is me working through the 2025 event for fun and practice. Expect a mix of clean solutions, experiments, and the occasional refactor after the fact.
